# clj-tenable-api

This library provides basic Tenable.io and Tenable.SC API functionality in Clojure.

## Usage

In its current form, you would want to edit `src/clj_tenable_api/core.clj` to substitute the appropriate values into `-main`. You also need to create the `src/clj_tenable_api/tenable_sc_keys.txt` file and put your Tenable.SC API keys in it. Just paste the access key into the first line, and the secret key into the second line, without any text or formatting.

Then, you can execute the project by running `lein run` from the same directory as this README file.
